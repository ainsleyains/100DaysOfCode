// Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers. Return your answer as a number.

function sumMix(x){
  return x.reduce((acc,cur)=>{
    return acc+ (+cur)},0)
}

sumMix([9, 3, '7', '3'])



// using the unary plus operator converts its operand to Number type, which is (+cur)
