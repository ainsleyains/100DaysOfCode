// Every month, a random number of students take the driving test at Fast & Furious (F&F) Driving School. To pass the test, a student cannot accumulate more than 18 demerit points.

// At the end of the month, F&F wants to calculate the average demerit points accumulated by ONLY the students who have passed, rounded to the nearest integer.

// Write a function which would allow them to do so. If no students passed the test that month, return 'No pass scores registered.'.


// Example:

// [10,10,10,18,20,20] --> 12



function passed (list) { 

const passed = list.filter(el=>el <= 18);
return passed.length ? Math.round(passed.reduce((acc,curr)=>acc + curr, 0) / passed.length) :'No pass scores registered.';

} 

passed([10,10,10,18,20,20])
