// In this Kata, you will be given two strings a and b and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

// For example:

// solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc" 
// --The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. 
// --The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. 



function solve(a,b){
 const strA = a.split('').filter(el=>!b.split('').includes(el)).join``
 const strB = b.split('').filter(el=>!a.split('').includes(el)).join``
 return strA.concat(strB);
};

solve("xyab","xzca")
