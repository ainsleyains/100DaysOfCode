// The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant. The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of the first n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30. After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he could have made a mistake.

// if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then new_avg(dons, 30) --> 149

// Could you help him?

// The function new_avg(arr, navg) should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average navg.


function newAvg(arr, newavg) {
   const sum = arr.reduce((acc,curr)=>acc+curr, 0);
   const newSum = newavg * (arr.length + 1);
   if (newavg < sum / arr.length) throw new Error("Expected New Average is too low");
   return Math.ceil(newSum - sum);
}

newAvg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15],30)
