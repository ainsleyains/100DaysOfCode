// Coding in function maxMin. function accept 2 parameter arr1 and arr2. They are two number array and have the same number of elements.

// First, calculate the difference of the same index of the arr1 and arr2. Like this:

// [1,3,5]
//  | | |   --->  8, 5, 2
// [9,8,7]
// Please note that the difference is positive. Such as the above 1 and 9, the difference should be 8, not -8. I think abs() can help you get the correct result ;-)

// Then find the maximum and minimum values of them, and return the results in the form of an array.



function maxMin(arr1,arr2){
  const sub = arr1.map((el,i)=>Math.abs(el - arr2[i]));
  return [Math.max(...sub), Math.min(...sub)];
  
}

maxMin([1,3,5],[9,8,7])
