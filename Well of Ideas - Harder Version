// For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!

// In this kata you need to check the provided 2 dimensional array (x) for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good ideas, return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.

// The sub arrays may not be the same length.

// The solution should be case insensitive (ie good, GOOD and gOOd all count as a good idea). All inputs may not be strings.


function well(x){
  let num = 0;
  x.map(el=>el.map(ele=>String(ele).toLowerCase() === 'good'? num++ : 1));
  return num > 2 ? 'I smell a series!': num < 1 ?'Fail!':'Publish!';
  
}


well([['gOOd', 'bAd', 'BAD', 'bad', 'bad', 'GOOD'], ['bad'], ['gOOd', 'BAD']])
