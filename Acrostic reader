// Write a program that reads an acrostic to identify the "hidden" word. Specifically, your program will receive a list of words (reprensenting an acrostic) and will need to return a string corresponding to the word that is spelled out by taking the first letter of each word in the acrostic.




function readOut(acrostic) {
  return acrostic.map(el=>el[0]).join``
}




// Alternative way
function readOut(acrostic) {
  return acrostic.map(el=>el.replace(/[a-z$]/g, '')).join``
}

readOut(['Jolly', 'Amazing', 'Courteous', 'Keen'])
