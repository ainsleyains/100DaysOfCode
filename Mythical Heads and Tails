// The formidable "Orthus" is a 2 headed dog with 1 tail. The mighty "Hydra" has 5 heads and 1 tail.

// Before Hercules goes in, he asks you "How many of each beast am I up against!?".

// You know the total number of heads and the total number of tails, that's the dangerous parts, right? But you didn't consider how many of each beast.


// Given the number of heads and the number of tails, work out the number of each mythical beast!

// The data is given as two parameters. Your answer should be returned as an array:

 // VALID ->      [24 , 15]           INVALID ->  "No solutions"
            // [Orthus, Hydra]
// If there aren't any cases for the given amount of heads and tails - return "No solutions" or null (C#).
