// Simple enough this one - you will be given an array. The values in the array will either be numbers or strings, or a mix of both. You will not get an empty array, nor a sparse one.

// Your job is to return a single array that has first the numbers sorted in ascending order, followed by the strings sorted in alphabetic order. The values must maintain their original type.

// Note that numbers written as strings are strings and must be sorted with the other strings.
