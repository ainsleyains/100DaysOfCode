// In this Kata, you will be given two numbers, a and b, and your task is to determine if the first number a is divisible by all the prime factors of the second number b. For example: solve(15,12) = False because 15 is not divisible by all the prime factors of 12 (which include2).



function solve(a,b){
  let factor = [], divisor = 2;
  while(b >= 2) {
    if(b % divisor === 0){
      factor.push(divisor)
      b = b / divisor 
    }else {
      divisor++
    }
  }

    for(let i = 0; i < factor.length; i++){
    if(a % factor[i] !== 0) {
      return false
    }
  }
  return true
};
