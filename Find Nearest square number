// Your task is to find the nearest square number, nearest_sq(n) or nearestSq(n), of a positive integer n.

// For example, if n = 111, then nearest\_sq(n) (nearestSq(n)) equals 121, since 111 is closer to 121, the square of 11, than 100, the square of 10.


function nearestSq(n){
    return Math.pow((Math.sqrt(n).toFixed(0)),2);
}

nearestSq(10)
