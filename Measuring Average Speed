// Average Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time. Given two strings as input the first of which indicates a codewarrior's distance travelled (in metres or kilometres) and the second indicating the time it takes them to travel (in seconds or minutes), return a string indicating their speed in miles per hour rounded to the nearest integer.

// For the purposes of this kata one metre per second is defined as 2.23694 miles per hour.

// So for example given the input values of distance & time "3km" and "5min" we should return a speed value of "22mph".



function calculateSpeed(distance, time) {
  const meter = distance.slice(-2)==='km' ? Number(distance.slice(0,-2))*1000: Number(distance.slice(0,-1));
  const second = time.slice(-3)==='min' ? Number(time.slice(0,-3))* 60 : Number(time.slice(0,-1));
  return Math.round(meter/second *2.23694) +'mph';
