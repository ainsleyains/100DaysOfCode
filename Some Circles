// Write a function that takes as its parameters one or more numbers which are the diameters of circles.

// The function should return the total area of all the circles, rounded to the nearest integer in a string that says "We have this much circle: xyz".

// You don't know how many circles you will be given, but you can assume it will be at least one.

// So:

// sumCircles(2) == "We have this much circle: 3"
// sumCircles(2, 3, 4) == "We have this much circle: 23"


function sumCircles(arr) {
  const area = Math.round([...arguments].reduce((acc,curr)=>acc + ((curr* 0.5) * (curr * 0.5))*Math.PI,0));
  return `We have this much circle: ${area}`

}
